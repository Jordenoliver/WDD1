                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> My wife started her business online though Etsy In January of 2021. When she started
                    she started with soap first. A little bit after she started soaps she wanted to try
                    somthing new, and added resin work into her business. She really enjoys doing both and
                    is consanly experimenting with new soap flavors and resin designs. She is wanting to add
                    candles in the near future to her business.
