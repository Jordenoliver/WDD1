                <h2>Hennry's Visit</h2>
                <p> We have heared amazing things about this places rapids, so the family and I decided to give it a try.
                    Let me tell you we were not disapponted. We opted to go with the harded rapid and bet to see who could stay on
                    till the end. We all lost but we had a blast, and hey I stayed on the longest. I highly recommend coming here.

                <h2>Victorias's Visit</h2>
                <p> A bunch of friends and I came out to go camping this weekend. We decide to camp one of the nearby mountains and other than the hike up to the camping spot
                    It was a great trip. The view was incredible and the experience was amazing. My only complaint was the hike to and from the camping spot.</p>

                <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great outdoors. </p>
